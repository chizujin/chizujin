- 👋 Hi, I’m @chizujin
- 👀 I’m interested in technical and SEO writing, geospatial data, and maps.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Figma, JSON, and Kubernetes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require data accuracy and documentation organization in the sphere of cloud computing, APIs, orotherwise.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've worked as a technical writer in three countries, and in my free time, I produce geospatial data sources to create maps. 
- - 📫 How to reach me ...
